## Purpose of the Project  

This project was developed to analyze employee attrition and workforce dynamics within an organization using historical HR data. Built with **Excel and Tableau**, the goal of the analysis is to understand why employees leave, identify high-risk departments and demographic groups, evaluate job satisfaction patterns, and provide actionable insights that can support employee retention, workforce planning, and strategic HR decision-making.

---

## Problem Statement  

Employee attrition poses a significant challenge to organizational stability, productivity, and long-term growth. The organization needs a clear understanding of **who is leaving**, **where attrition is concentrated**, and **what factors are influencing employee turnover**.

Specifically, there is a need to:
- Measure overall workforce stability and attrition rate  
- Identify departments and job roles with the highest attrition  
- Understand how age, gender, and education background influence turnover  
- Evaluate job satisfaction levels and their relationship with employee retention  

---

## Pre-Analysis Questions  

- What is the overall attrition rate in the organization?  
- Which departments experience the highest employee turnover?  
- Which age group is most affected by attrition?  
- Does gender play a role in employee attrition?  
- How does education background influence attrition?  
- How do job satisfaction ratings vary across job roles?  
- Are early-career employees more likely to leave the organization?  

---

## Data Cleaning  

Before visualization in Tableau, the HR dataset was prepared and validated using Excel:

- Removed duplicate employee records and empty rows  
- Ensured numeric consistency for age, satisfaction ratings, and employee counts  
- Standardized department, job role, and education field labels  
- Verified attrition status consistency across records  
- Confirmed age data fell within realistic workforce ranges  
- Grouped age values into meaningful bins for analysis  

---

## Post-Analysis Board (Tableau Story – Insight Synthesis)  

After exploratory analysis, insights were consolidated into actionable narratives:

- R&D and Sales departments account for the majority of attrition  
- Employees aged 25–34 show the highest exit rates  
- Male attrition exceeds female attrition in absolute numbers  
- Life Sciences and Medical education backgrounds show higher attrition  
- Job satisfaction varies significantly by role and correlates with retention risk  

These findings were validated across multiple visualizations to ensure consistency.

## Charts Used and Analytical Purpose  

### KPI Cards  
Used to present headline workforce metrics for quick executive understanding.

### Pie Chart (Department-wise Attrition)  
Highlights proportional contribution of each department to total attrition.

### Histogram (Employee Count by Age Group)  
Shows workforce concentration and identifies age groups with higher exit exposure.

### Bar Charts  
Used to compare attrition across education fields and genders.

### Donut Charts (Attrition by Gender and Age Group)  
Reveal demographic attrition patterns and age–gender interaction effects.

### Heatmap Table (Job Satisfaction by Role)  
Visualizes satisfaction distribution and highlights low-engagement roles.

---

## Key Patterns, Correlations, and Anomalies  

- Attrition is disproportionately high in R&D and Sales departments  
- Early-career employees (25–34) are most likely to leave  
- Higher job satisfaction generally aligns with lower attrition risk  
- Education fields with strong external demand experience higher turnover  
- Attrition declines significantly beyond age 45, indicating greater stability  

No extreme anomalies were observed; however, concentration patterns suggest systemic rather than random attrition.

---

## Observations  

### Attrition Rate of 16.12%  
- Indicates moderate to high employee turnover  
- Suggests the need for targeted retention strategies  

### R&D and Sales Are High-Risk Departments  
- Together account for over 94% of attrition  
- Likely driven by workload pressure, performance targets, or limited growth opportunities  

### Early-Career Employees Are Most Vulnerable  
- Ages 25–34 show the highest attrition  
- Employees may be seeking better compensation, growth, or flexibility  

### Male Attrition Is Higher  
- Males account for approximately 63% of total attrition  
- May reflect role distribution, job stress, or external opportunities  

### Education Background Matters  
- Life Sciences and Medical employees show higher attrition  
- Likely influenced by competitive external labor demand  

### Job Satisfaction Correlates with Stability  
- Roles with higher satisfaction ratings show better retention  
- Lower satisfaction clusters indicate areas for HR intervention

## Detailed Recommendations  

### Organization-Wide Recommendations  
- Set a target attrition benchmark below 12%  
- Introduce structured exit and stay interviews  
- Monitor attrition monthly using Tableau dashboards  
- Integrate HR analytics into strategic planning  

### Department-Specific Recommendations  
- **R&D:** Reduce burnout through workload management, innovation incentives, and clear career paths  
- **Sales:** Redesign performance and commission structures to support sustainable output  
- **HR:** Strengthen HR capacity and invest in analytics-driven people management  

### Age-Based Recommendations  
- Provide fast-track career development for employees aged 25–34  
- Introduce mentorship and leadership exposure programs  
- Offer flexible work arrangements to support work-life balance  

### Gender and Inclusion Recommendations  
- Ensure equitable promotion and compensation practices  
- Expand flexible and hybrid work options  
- Promote inclusive leadership training  

### Education Field Retention Strategies  
- Offer professional development sponsorships  
- Strengthen internal research and learning opportunities  
- Introduce retention incentives tied to tenure milestones  

### Job Satisfaction Improvement  
- Conduct regular satisfaction surveys  
- Train managers in people leadership and emotional intelligence  
- Align role expectations with performance evaluations

## Conclusion  

This analysis demonstrates the power of data visualization and analytics in uncovering meaningful HR insights. By systematically examining attrition through demographic, departmental, and satisfaction lenses, the organization gains a clear understanding of where workforce risks exist.

The findings show that attrition is concentrated rather than random and can be effectively managed through targeted, data-driven interventions. Implementing the recommended strategies will enhance employee retention, reduce operational costs, and support long-term organizational sustainability.
